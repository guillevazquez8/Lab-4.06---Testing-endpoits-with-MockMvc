# Lab 4.06: Creating an API and testing endpoits with MockMvc

1. Starting with database creation and modelling, I had to make a hospital API with employees and patients databases

2. Interact with them with different queries through the repositories

3. Implement business logic on the service layer, to create the functionalities I'd need in a Hospital app

4. Create the GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE endpoints on the controller layer

5. Finally, testing these endpoints with JUnit and MockMvc
